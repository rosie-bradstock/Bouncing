# Simulation of a bouncing ball

This repo is intended to doccument my progress in creating a simulation of a bouncing ball.

I am using python with pygame, as I want to challenge myself more in creating the movement of the ball more than with my coding. Using a language that I am already familiar with will therefore speed this up significantly.

I am going to try to get as far as possible without any outside help - I moreso want to see what I can achieve with only my own knowledge at this point.

Once I reach a dead end, I'll do some research in how I can improve my program, and hopefully I will eventually end up with something alright.
